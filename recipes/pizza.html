        <li>.9 ounce flaxseed meal (about 1/4 cup) </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum </li>
        <li>holy shit when does this list end...</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>
        <li>2 large egg whites </li>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>¾ cup lower-sodium marinara sauce (such as Dell'Amore) </li>
        <li>4 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 cup) </li>
        <li>2 ounces sliced turkey pepperoni </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Finnaly, the steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
           Combine 1/2 cup water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Let stand 5 minutes or until yeast mixture is bubble.
        </li>
        <li>Weigh or lightly spoon flours, potato starch, and flaxseed meal into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours, potato starch, flaxseed meal, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed until blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 tablespoon oil, egg whites, and egg; beat at low speed 1 minute or until combined. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Scrape dough onto pan. Lightly coat hands with oil. Press dough into a 14-inch circle, coating hands with oil as needed to prevent dough from sticking. Coat top of dough with any remaining oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap, and bake crust at 400° for 17 minutes or until bottom lightly browns. Cool completely. Increase oven temperature to 425°.</li>
        <li>Spread marinara over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border; top with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425° for 16 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese melts.</li>
    </ol>
