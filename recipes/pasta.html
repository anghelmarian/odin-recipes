    <p>This classic white pasta sauce recipe is surprisingly simple to make. In just minutes, you can whip this up for dinner. White pasta sauce uses simple and common pantry items making this very inexpensive and convenie</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Penne Pasta</li>
        <li>Butter </li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Milk </li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan Cheese </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let's cook this bitch</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta that you plan to use. I prefer to cook it al dente. </li>
        <li>Make the sauce. Start by melting the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat. Then add in the minced garlic and cook this for another minute. The garlic simmering will make your kitchen smell wonderful but be careful not to overcook it. </li>
        <li>Next, whisk in the flour and cook for about a minute. The butter flour mixture should start to thicken slightly. Watch it carefully so the flour does not burn.</li>
        <li>The next step is to whisk in the cup milk and broth. This needs to be stirred constantly until the sauce starts to boil and the sauce thickens. </li>
        <li>Finally, add in the grated parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Stir all of this together until the cheese has melted. If you want the sauce extra cheesy, add an extra Â¼ cup cheese. </li>
        <li>Now just stir in the pasta and serve immediately. You can sprinkle with parsley if you have some on hand.</li>
    </ol>
